      <p>A nursing puppy/kitten receives antibodies from its mothers milk that protect it from disease during the first weeks of life.  These antibodies gradually decrease during the first few months of a puppys/kittens life.  Therefore we give puppies/kittens a series of 3-4 vaccine doses spread out.  All adult pets should be vaccinated yearly.</p>
